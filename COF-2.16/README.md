# COF - Coretôr Ortografic Furlan

## Overview

**COF** (Coretôr Ortografic Furlan) is the original Friulian spell checker developed by Franz Feregot. This is the reference implementation written in Perl, serving as the authoritative source for the Friulian language spell checking algorithm and dictionary management.

> **⚠️ Important Notice**: This repository contains the original, unmodified COF source code that should be preserved as-is for historical and reference purposes. Any modifications should be made in derivative projects, not in this original codebase.

## Project History

This repository represents version **2.16** of COF, built on **20110620** with lemmas version **20150417**. The software includes both a graphical user interface and command-line tools for Friulian spell checking.

### Repository Structure

**Original files** (from initial commit 01ad001, April 20, 2021):
- Core Perl modules in `lib/COF/`
- GUI and CLI scripts: `script/cof.pl`, `script/cof_oo_cli.pl`
- OpenOffice plugin in `COFOOPlugin/`
- Resources and icons in `res/`

**Files added for testing and documentation**:
- `README.md` - This documentation

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **COF::App** - Main application entry point with Wx GUI framework
2. **COF::Data** - Dictionary and language data management
3. **COF::SpellChecker** - Core spell checking logic
4. **COF::FastChecker** - Text processing and error detection engine  
5. **COF::RadixTree** - Efficient dictionary storage and lookup
6. **COF::Letters** - Friulian character set definitions
7. **COF::Frame** - Main GUI window and user interface

### Key Features

#### 1. Phonetic Algorithm (`phalg_furlan`)
The heart of COF's spell checking is a sophisticated phonetic algorithm located in `COF::Data::phalg_furlan` that:

- Generates dual phonetic hashes (primo/secondo) for Friulian words
- Normalizes accented characters (à/á/â → a, è/é/ê → e, etc.)
- Handles Friulian-specific sequences (çi/çe, sci/sce, cj patterns)
- Implements complex vowel and consonant transformations
- Supports phonetic similarity matching for suggestions

**Algorithm Flow:**
```perl
Input: "sciençe" 
  → Preparation: normalize accents, handle ç sequences, compress doubles
  → Hash Generation: apply different rules to primo/secondo hashes  
  → Vowel Mapping: diphthongs first (ai→6, ei→7), then singles (a→6, e→7)
  → Consonant Mapping: context-sensitive transformations (^t→H, ^d→I)
Output: ("A75ç7", "E775ç7")
```

#### 2. Dictionary System
- **System Dictionary**: Core Friulian vocabulary stored in RadixTree format
- **User Dictionary**: Personal additions with phonetic indexing
- **Exception Dictionary**: Words that override default rules
- **Frequency Dictionary**: Usage statistics for word ranking

#### 3. Text Processing
- **Word Iterator**: Tokenizes text respecting Friulian word boundaries
- **Context Analysis**: Considers surrounding words for better suggestions
- **Automatic Correction**: Learns from user corrections

#### 4. Suggestion Engine
- **Phonetic Matching**: Uses dual hash system for sound-alike words
- **Edit Distance**: Levenshtein distance with Friulian-specific costs
- **Frequency Ranking**: Prioritizes common words in suggestions

## Installation & Testing on Windows

### Prerequisites

Install **Strawberry Perl** using Chocolatey:

```powershell
# Install Chocolatey if not already installed
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; 
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; 
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

# Install Strawberry Perl
choco install strawberryperl

# Refresh environment variables
refreshenv
# OR restart PowerShell session
```

### Install Dependencies

```powershell
# Navigate to COF directory
cd "path\to\COF\COF-2.16"

# Install required Perl modules
cpan install Params::Validate
cpan install File::HomeDir  
cpan install Wx
cpan install Wx::Perl::ListCtrl
cpan install Try::Tiny
cpan install Carp::Always
```

### Build and Run

```powershell
# Build the project
perl Build.PL
perl Build

# Run phonetic algorithm tests
perl tests/test_phonetic_perl.pl

# Launch GUI application

## Testing the Phonetic Algorithm

The repository includes a comprehensive test suite for the phonetic algorithm with 47 test cases covering:

- **Basic Words**: Common Friulian vocabulary
- **Diphthongs**: ai, ei, ou, oi, vu sequences  
- **Consonant Clusters**: cj, gj, sci/sce patterns
- **Accented Characters**: à/â/á, è/ê/é variations
- **Edge Cases**: Start-of-word consonants, special endings

```powershell
# Run phonetic tests
perl tests/test_phonetic_perl.pl

# Expected output format:
# word -> ("hash1", "hash2")
# cjatâ -> ("A696", "c7696")
```

## Historical Context

COF was developed as part of efforts to preserve and promote the Friulian language through digital tools. The phonetic algorithm represents years of linguistic research into Friulian phonology and orthography patterns.

This codebase serves as the reference implementation for:
- Cross-platform Friulian spell checkers
- Phonetic similarity algorithms for minority languages
- Dictionary management systems for agglutinative languages
- Academic research into computational linguistics for Friulian
